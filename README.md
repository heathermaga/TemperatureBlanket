Project Title
Digital Tempreature Blanket

Description
Displays on a page colours in lines for the temperatures for the year for a certain location. 
Only able to fetch the last  7 days so there would be some mesure of mindfulness to go in and load the colour blanket every few days. 
Temperatures are stored in a JSON file so it could be manually updated as well.
